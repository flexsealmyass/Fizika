## Electric field
Is the measure of force applied to any charge at a certain point in space **P** by existing charges **q<sub>1</sub>, q<sub>2</sub>, ... q<sub>N</sub>**.
### derivation from Coulomb's law
$$
\boxed{\tag*{Coulomb's law}F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}}
$$
$$

$$
This essentially boils down to "How much force will a charged particle experience at a point in space, where an electric field is present.". This is a very convenient understanding when looking at the electric field as a vector field realized, most commonly, on a plane, as it allows for easy identification, and prediction of forces applied to a charge once in the given arrangment since it scales linearly with the charge value.
